The Google Maps tool I use is experiencing issues.\n\nHowever, I can still help you plan your trip to Yosemite from May 11th to 17th.  Since I can't provide directions directly, I suggest checking Google Maps or other mapping services directly for the most up-to-date route information.  \n\nKeep in mind that the drive from San Francisco to Yosemite is quite scenic but can be long, depending on your exact destination within Yosemite National Park.  You might consider looking into transportation options beyond driving, such as a shuttle or tour, especially if you're not comfortable with a long drive.  I can help you find information on those if you'd like.",
